    # summary: |
    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student at IPE Thrust at HKUST(GZ), under the supervision of [Prof. Luoye Chen](https://luoyec.github.io/). Before that, I completed my Master's degree at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at SUSTech, supervised by [Prof. Bingyi Jing](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/jingbing-yi.html). I also hold a Bachelor's degree from the Institute for Advanced Study at Shenzhen University.

My research interests focus on data mining and analysis, machine learning, energy & environmental economics, and AI for science. At HKUST(GZ), I aim to further explore the intersection of AI and environmental science, particularly in the context of sustainable agriculture.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy riding, tennis, and doing volunteer work. I believe that a balanced life is essential for sustained academic excellence. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me.
